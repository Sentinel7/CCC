# Canadian Computing Competition

This repository contains all of the programs I have written from the Canadian Computing Competition problems. Every year there is a new contest where high school students can participate in the competition, created by the University of Waterloo. I have completed some of the past years contests in Java and put the solutions into this repo. The following website contains all of the past contests: http://www.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests.html#ccc
